His research\u00a0explores new training methods through which generative AI models can be taught to implicitly obey design constraints and synthesize higher-performing designs. Knowing that prospective designers often have an intimate knowledge of the needs of users,\u00a0but may otherwise lack the technical training to create solutions, Regenwetter also develops human-AI collaborative tools that allow AI models to interact and support designers in popular CAD software and real design problems.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Solving a whale of a problem\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lo\u00efcka\u00a0Baille<br \/>Hometown: L\u2019Escale, France<br \/>Advisor: Daniel Zitterbart<br \/>Interests: Being outdoors\u00a0\u2014 scuba diving, spelunking, or climbing. Sailing on the Charles River, martial arts classes, and playing volleyball<\/p>\n<p>Lo\u00efcka\u00a0Baille\u2019s research focuses on developing remote sensing technologies to study and protect marine life. Her main project revolves around improving onboard whale detection technology to prevent vessel strikes, with a special focus on protecting North Atlantic right whales. Baille is also involved in an ongoing study of Emperor penguins. Her team visits Antarctica annually to tag penguins and gather data to enhance their understanding of penguin population dynamics and draw conclusions regarding the overall health of the ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Water, water anywhere<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Carlos D\u00edaz-Mar\u00edn<br \/>Hometown: San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica<br \/>Advisor: Professor Gang Chen | Former Advisor: Professor Evelyn Wang<br \/>Interests: New England hiking, biking, and dancing<\/p>\n<p>Carlos D\u00edaz-Mar\u00edn designs and synthesizes inexpensive salt-polymer materials that can capture large amounts of humidity from the air. He aims to change the way we generate potable water from the air, even in arid conditions. In addition to water generation, these salt-polymer materials can also be used as thermal batteries, capable of storing and reusing heat. Beyond the scientific applications, D\u00edaz-Mar\u00edn is excited to continue doing research that can have big social impacts, and that finds and explains new physical phenomena. As a LatinX person, D\u00edaz-Mar\u00edn is also driven to help increase diversity in STEM.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Scalable fabrication of nano-architected materials<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Somayajulu Dhulipala<br \/>Hometown: Hyderabad, India<br \/>Advisor: Assistant Professor Carlos Portela<br \/>Interests: Space exploration, taekwondo, meditation.<\/p>\n<p>Somayajulu Dhulipala works on developing lightweight materials with tunable mechanical properties. He is currently working on methods for the scalable fabrication of nano-architected materials and predicting their mechanical properties. The ability to fine-tune the mechanical properties of specific\u00a0materials brings versatility and adaptability, making these materials suitable for a wide range of applications across multiple industries. While the research applications are quite diverse, Dhulipala is passionate about making space habitable for humanity, a crucial step toward becoming a spacefaring civilization.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ingestible health-care devices<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Jimmy McRae<br \/>Hometown: Woburn, Massachusetts<br \/>Advisor: Associate Professor Giovani Traverso<br \/>Interests: Anything basketball-related: playing, watching, going to games, organizing hometown tournaments\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Jimmy McRae aims to drastically improve diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities through noninvasive health-care technologies. His research focuses on leveraging materials, mechanics, embedded systems, and microfabrication to develop novel ingestible electronic and mechatronic devices. This ranges from ingestible electroceutical\u00a0capsules\u00a0that modulate\u00a0hunger-regulating\u00a0hormones to devices capable of continuous ultralong monitoring and remotely triggerable actuations from within the stomach. The principles that guide McRae\u2019s work to develop devices that function in extreme environments can be applied far beyond the gastrointestinal tract, with applications for outer space, the ocean, and more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Freestyle BMX meets machine learning<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Eva Nates<br \/>Hometown: Narberth, Pennsylvania\u00a0<br \/>Advisor: Professor Peko Hosoi<br \/>Interests: Rowing, running, biking, hiking, baking<\/p>\n<p>Eva Nates is working with the Australian Cycling Team to create a tool to classify Bicycle Motocross Freestyle (BMX FS) tricks.\u00a0She uses a singular value\u00a0decomposition method to conduct a principal\u00a0component\u00a0analysis of the time-dependent point-tracking data of an athlete and their bike during a run to classify each trick.\u00a0The 2024 Olympic team hopes to incorporate this tool in their training workflow, and Nates worked alongside the team at their facilities on the Gold Coast of Australia during MIT\u2019s Independent Activities Period in January.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Augmenting Astronauts with Wearable Limbs\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Erik Ballesteros<br \/>Hometown: Spring, Texas<br \/>Advisor: Professor Harry Asada<br \/>Interests: Cosplay, Star Wars, Lego bricks<\/p>\n<p>Erik Ballesteros\u2019s research seeks to support astronauts who are conducting planetary extravehicular activities through the use of supernumerary robotic limbs (SuperLimbs).
