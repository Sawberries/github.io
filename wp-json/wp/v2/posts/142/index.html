How do you choose classes?<\/b><br \/>\nIt depends on your goals and interests. Here are some questions to ask.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>Goal:\u00a0<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li>What do you want to achieve out of a particular course?\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Are you learning for fun or do you want to apply the knowledge to build something?<\/li>\n<li>Do you want to extend\/switch careers to become a Deep Learning practitioner?<\/li>\n<li>Do you think these tools will help you solve a real-life problem?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li>Interests:<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li>Read through the course page, find out the topics they cover and search for applications\/projects related to it. Do these topics interest you? Here is <a href=\"http:\/\/ankit-ai.blogspot.com\/2019\/11\/my-review-of-stanfords-online.html\">my review<\/a> on some of the classes to help you get started.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>2. Reference Materials for classes?<\/b><\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>Most classes at Stanford are self-contained but you are welcomed to read and research resources, there is tons of literature on most topics as it&#8217;s an active field of research.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Teaching staff usually provides references for each topic which help you consolidate concepts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>3. Are there any forums to discuss doubts? Is there any form of Mentorship provided?<\/b><\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>There are Course Assistants for every class and there is also a forum setup per class where you can discuss doubts and ask questions to help solidify your understanding.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>You are also assigned a Mentor for your project which is one of the course assistants for the class. They help give feedback and suggestions to help you navigate and sketch out scope of a project.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>\n<b>4. What can you get out of a class project?<\/b><\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>A class project can be an open research problem, your attempt at reproducing ideas presented in a paper or simply applying fundamentals to a real-life problem. This is one of the most interesting parts of the courses which helps you exercise what you have learnt and even explore beyond the class.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Choosing challenging course projects helps you explore and become better at applying concepts and figure out how to use these tools in real-life problems.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>5. What Programming Language is preferred?<\/b><\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>Most classes require you to code in Python.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>6. Why is it still worth taking the course when you have online courses at a much lower cost?<\/b><\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>These are actual &#8220;Graduate&#8221; courses taken by students at Stanford. I have found them to be quite challenging but at the same time rewarding in ways that broaden your horizon and knowledge with State-of-the-Art (SoTA) literature and techniques.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>I would suggest using other online courses as basics to build upon with these Graduate level classes.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b><br \/><\/b><br \/>\n<b>7. Why one shouldn&#8217;t one be\u00a0<\/b><b>judgmental<\/b><b>\u00a0about this course since it is a &#8220;Graduate Certificate&#8221; unlike a full time Master&#8217;s course?<\/b><\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>Graduate level courses are more abstract compared to their undergraduate counterparts. Again, It depends on what your goals are, if you have a Master&#8217;s you can update yourself with these classes.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>On the other hand, my understanding is that the same courses can be taken as part of an online Master&#8217;s program.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><\/p>\n<style type=\"text\/css\">\np.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 8.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px 'Trebuchet MS'; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000}\np.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 8.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px 'Trebuchet MS'; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; min-height: 12.0px}\nli.li1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 8.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px 'Trebuchet MS'; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000}\nspan.s1 {font-kerning: none}\nol.ol1 {list-style-type: decimal}\n<\/style>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have been asked a lot of questions lately about Stanford&#8217;s online course offerings and why somebody would choose them over myriad of options online.
