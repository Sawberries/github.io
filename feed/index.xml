<p>Focused on the part of the sky where you can spot the constellation Orion (“The Hunter”) on clear nights, the<a href="http://thisiscolossal.com/tags/james-webb-space-telescope"> James Webb Space Telescope</a>’s latest dispatch blinks in astonishing images from an area known as the Orion B molecular cloud.</p>
<p>At 1,300 light-years away—more than 7.8 <em>quadrillion</em> miles from Earth—the cloud is the closest star-forming region to our solar system. And rising from the turbulent field of gas and dust is Barnard 33, commonly known as the Horsehead Nebula. The gradually collapsing, interstellar cloud is more than 5.8 billion miles tall, composed of material illuminated by a hot star nearby. Over millions of years, the gas clouds surrounding the formation have dissipated, but the pillar remaining today is composed of thick clumps that are harder to erode, providing scientists with a perfect subject for study.</p>
<p>Webb zoomed in on the top crest of the nebula to capture the region’s complexity with never-before-seen spatial resolution. Using imagery from the telescope’s MIRI and NIRCam instruments, an international team of astronomers has revealed small-scale structures along the illuminated edge of the Horsehead for the first time.</p>
<p>In addition to photographs, the team has released a mesmerizing gyroscopic video, taking us on a journey through the light-years in just under two minutes and providing a sense of the enormous scale and distance Webb documents.

<p>“You know how when you smell a fragrance that brings you to a specific time—like if you wore a certain scent for a year in college or if your grandmother always smelled like Channel No. 5—each time you smell that fragrance it brings you right back,” says <a href="https://www.hisuzanne.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suzanne Saroff</a>. “The process of chewing the gum for this series did that in a jarring way.”</p>
<p>Saroff is referring to a new body of work highlighting tiny bubblegum sculptures on the brink of deflating or popping. Conjuring memories of childhood competitions and absent-minded chomping, the photos zoom in on chewed wads of pink, blue, and green that appear almost corporeal, their pudgy folds and pockets evoking the beauty and repulsion of the human body.</p>
<p>The series started instinctively when Saroff spotted a pack of gum in her studio. Having previously photographed ephemeral subject matter like flowers, fish, and milk bubbles, the stretchy material was a welcome direction even though it popped within seconds of blowing. She made several trips to the nearest bodega for different flavors and colors and eventually, assembled dozens of combinations. “With <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C00RCZfup1h/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the milk bubbles</a>, I was interested in capturing something a bit mischievous and visceral that pops within seconds. The bubble gum is a continuation of that,” she adds.</p>

<p>Whether deep in slumber or perched on ornamental pedestals, <a href="https://www.verginer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Willy Verginer</a>’s bold, whimsical sculptures (<a href="http://thisiscolossal.com/tags/willy-verginer">previously</a>) invite us into a surreal dream world. His latest series, <em>The Lost Garden, </em>draws on the paradisiacal notion of Eden and the alpine landscape and animals of the Dolomite Mountains near the artist’s home in northern Italy.</p>
<p>Verginer uses linden, or basswood, to chisel life-size sculptures of birds, bears, and human figures who merge with their natural surroundings. For example, in “Il fiume e la notte,” or “the river and the night,” a child sleeps atop a thicket of branches, simultaneously calm yet balancing precariously on thin supports. And in “Fiore del giardino,” or “garden flower,” a child’s head and shoulders are tightly enveloped with magenta flowers like a cloak.</p>
<p>Like much of Verginer’s work, <em>The Lost Garden </em>draws correlations and contrasts between society’s quickly advancing technologies and the way our reliance on phones or cars further separates us from nature. The artist’s sculptures stand like totems or nostalgic emblems, calling on a desire for a more interconnected world.</p>
<p>Verginer is working toward a solo exhibition at <a href="https://www.studioraffaelli.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studio d’Arte Raffaelli</a> in Trento, Italy, this autumn.
