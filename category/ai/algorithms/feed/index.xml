										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>The return of spring in the Northern Hemisphere touches off tornado season. A tornado&#8217;s twisting funnel of dust and debris seems an unmistakable sight. But that sight can be obscured to radar, the tool of meteorologists. It&#8217;s hard to know exactly when a tornado has formed, or even why.</p>
<p>A new dataset could hold answers. It contains radar returns from thousands of tornadoes that have hit the United States in the past 10 years. Storms that spawned tornadoes are flanked by other severe storms, some with nearly identical conditions, that never did. MIT Lincoln Laboratory researchers who curated the dataset, called <a href="https://github.com/mit-ll/tornet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TorNet</a>, have now released it open source. They hope to enable breakthroughs in detecting one of nature&#8217;s most mysterious and violent phenomena.</p>
<p>“A lot of progress is driven by easily available, benchmark datasets. We hope TorNet will lay a foundation for machine learning algorithms to both detect and predict tornadoes,” says Mark Veillette, the project&#8217;s co-principal investigator with James Kurdzo. Both researchers work in the Air Traffic Control Systems Group. </p>
<p>Along with the dataset, the team is releasing models trained on it. The models show promise for machine learning&#8217;s ability to spot a twister. Building on this work could open new frontiers for forecasters, helping them provide more accurate warnings that might save lives. </p>
<p><strong>Swirling uncertainty</strong></p>
<p>About 1,200 tornadoes occur in the United States every year, causing millions to billions of dollars in <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/237409/economic-damage-caused-by-tornadoes-in-us/">economic damage</a> and claiming 71 lives on average. Last year, one unusually <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/498732c9fda04e6c85118c8e96e47de7">long-lasting tornado</a> killed 17 people and injured at least 165 others along a 59-mile path in Mississippi.  </p>
<p>Yet tornadoes are notoriously difficult to forecast because scientists don&#8217;t have a clear picture of why they form. “We can see two storms that look identical, and one will produce a tornado and one won&#8217;t. We don&#8217;t fully understand it,” Kurdzo says.</p>
<p>A tornado’s basic ingredients are thunderstorms with instability caused by rapidly rising warm air and wind shear that causes rotation. Weather radar is the primary tool used to monitor these conditions. But tornadoes lay too low to be detected, even when moderately close to the radar. As the radar beam with a given tilt angle travels further from the antenna, it gets higher above the ground, mostly seeing reflections from rain and hail carried in the “mesocyclone,” the storm&#8217;s broad, rotating updraft. A mesocyclone doesn&#8217;t always produce a tornado.</p>
<p>With this limited view, forecasters must decide whether or not to issue a tornado warning. They often err on the side of caution. As a result, the rate of false alarms for tornado warnings is more than 70 percent. “That can lead to boy-who-cried-wolf syndrome,” Kurdzo says.  </p>
<p>In recent years, researchers have turned to machine learning to better detect and predict tornadoes. However, raw datasets and models have not always been accessible to the broader community, stifling progress. TorNet is filling this gap.</p>
<p>The dataset contains more than 200,000 radar images, 13,587 of which depict tornadoes. The rest of the images are non-tornadic, taken from storms in one of two categories: randomly selected severe storms or false-alarm storms (those that led a forecaster to issue a warning but that didn’t produce a tornado).</p>
<p>Each sample of a storm or tornado comprises two sets of six radar images. The two sets correspond to different radar sweep angles. The six images portray different radar data products, such as reflectivity (showing precipitation intensity) or radial velocity (indicating if winds are moving toward or away from the radar).</p>
<p>A challenge in curating the dataset was first finding tornadoes. Within the corpus of weather radar data, tornadoes are extremely rare events. The team then had to balance those tornado samples with difficult non-tornado samples. If the dataset were too easy, say by comparing tornadoes to snowstorms, an algorithm trained on the data would likely over-classify storms as tornadic.</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s beautiful about a true benchmark dataset is that we&#8217;re all working with the same data, with the same level of difficulty, and can compare results,” Veillette says. “It also makes meteorology more accessible to data scientists, and vice versa. It becomes easier for these two parties to work on a common problem.”</p>
<p>Both researchers represent the progress that can come from cross-collaboration. Veillette is a mathematician and algorithm developer who has long been fascinated by tornadoes. Kurdzo is a meteorologist by training and a signal processing expert. In grad school, he chased tornadoes with custom-built mobile radars, collecting data to analyze in new ways.</p>
<p>“This dataset also means that a grad student doesn&#8217;t have to spend a year or two building a dataset. They can jump right into their research,” Kurdzo says.</p>
<p>This project was funded by Lincoln Laboratory&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/technology-office/climate-change-technology-national-security">Climate Change Initiative</a>, which aims to leverage the laboratory&#8217;s diverse technical strengths to help address climate problems threatening human health and global security.</p>
<p><strong>Chasing answers with deep learning</strong></p>
<p>Using the dataset, the researchers developed baseline artificial intelligence (AI) models. They were particularly eager to apply deep learning, a form of machine learning that excels at processing visual data. On its own, deep learning can extract features (key observations that an algorithm uses to make a decision) from images across a dataset. Other machine learning approaches require humans to first manually label features. </p>
<p>“We wanted to see if deep learning could rediscover what people normally look for in tornadoes and even identify new things that typically aren&#8217;t searched for by forecasters,” Veillette says.</p>
<p>The results are promising. Their deep learning model performed similar to or better than all tornado-detecting algorithms known in literature. The trained algorithm correctly classified 50 percent of weaker EF-1 tornadoes and over 85 percent of tornadoes rated EF-2 or higher, which make up the most devastating and costly occurrences of these storms.</p>
<p>They also evaluated two other types of machine-learning models, and one traditional model to compare against. The source code and parameters of all these models are freely available. The models and dataset are also described in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16437">paper</a> submitted to a journal of the American Meteorological Society (AMS). Veillette presented this work at the AMS Annual Meeting in January.</p>
<p>“The biggest reason for putting our models out there is for the community to improve upon them and do other great things,” Kurdzo says. “The best solution could be a deep learning model, or someone might find that a non-deep learning model is actually better.”</p>
<p>TorNet could be useful in the weather community for others uses too, such as for conducting large-scale case studies on storms. It could also be augmented with other data sources, like satellite imagery or lightning maps. Fusing multiple types of data could improve the accuracy of machine learning models.</p>
<p><strong>Taking steps toward operations</strong></p>
<p>On top of detecting tornadoes, Kurdzo hopes that models might help unravel the science of why they form.</p>
<p>“As scientists, we see all these precursors to tornadoes — an increase in low-level rotation, a hook echo in reflectivity data, specific differential phase (KDP) foot and differential reflectivity (ZDR) arcs. But how do they all go together? And are there physical manifestations we don&#8217;t know about?” he asks.</p>
<p>Teasing out those answers might be possible with explainable AI. Explainable AI refers to methods that allow a model to provide its reasoning, in a format understandable to humans, of why it came to a certain decision. In this case, these explanations might reveal physical processes that happen before tornadoes. This knowledge could help train forecasters, and models, to recognize the signs sooner. </p>
<p>“None of this technology is ever meant to replace a forecaster. But perhaps someday it could guide forecasters&#8217; eyes in complex situations, and give a visual warning to an area predicted to have tornadic activity,” Kurdzo says.</p>
<p>Such assistance could be especially useful as radar technology improves and future networks potentially grow denser. Data refresh rates in a next-generation radar network are expected to increase from every five minutes to approximately one minute, perhaps faster than forecasters can interpret the new information. Because deep learning can process huge amounts of data quickly, it could be well-suited for monitoring radar returns in real time, alongside humans. Tornadoes can form and disappear in minutes.</p>
<p>But the path to an operational algorithm is a long road, especially in safety-critical situations, Veillette says. “I think the forecaster community is still, understandably, skeptical of machine learning. One way to establish trust and transparency is to have public benchmark datasets like this one. It&#8217;s a first step.”</p>
<p>The next steps, the team hopes, will be taken by researchers across the world who are inspired by the dataset and energized to build their own algorithms. Those algorithms will in turn go into test beds, where they&#8217;ll eventually be shown to forecasters, to start a process of transitioning into operations.</p>
<p>In the end, the path could circle back to trust.</p>
<p>“We may never get more than a 10- to 15-minute tornado warning using these tools. But if we could lower the false-alarm rate, we could start to make headway with public perception,” Kurdzo says. “People are going to use those warnings to take the action they need to save their lives.”</p>

<p>To build AI systems that can collaborate effectively with humans, it helps to have a good model of human behavior to start with. But humans tend to behave suboptimally when making decisions.</p>
<p>This irrationality, which is especially difficult to model, often boils down to computational constraints. A human can’t spend decades thinking about the ideal solution to a single problem.</p>
<p>Researchers at MIT and the University of Washington developed a way to model the behavior of an agent, whether human or machine, that accounts for the unknown computational constraints that may hamper the agent’s problem-solving abilities.</p>
<p>Their model can automatically infer an agent’s computational constraints by seeing just a few traces of their previous actions. The result, an agent’s so-called “inference budget,” can be used to predict that agent’s future behavior.</p>
<p>In a new paper, the researchers demonstrate how their method can be used to infer someone’s navigation goals from prior routes and to predict players’ subsequent moves in chess matches. Their technique matches or outperforms another popular method for modeling this type of decision-making.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this work could help scientists teach AI systems how humans behave, which could enable these systems to respond better to their human collaborators. Being able to understand a human’s behavior, and then to infer their goals from that behavior, could make an AI assistant much more useful, says Athul Paul Jacob, an electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) graduate student and lead author of a <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=W3VsHuga3j" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper on this technique</a>.</p>
<p>“If we know that a human is about to make a mistake, having seen how they have behaved before, the AI agent could step in and offer a better way to do it. Or the agent could adapt to the weaknesses that its human collaborators have. Being able to model human behavior is an important step toward building an AI agent that can actually help that human,” he says.</p>
<p>Jacob wrote the paper with Abhishek Gupta, assistant professor at the University of Washington, and senior author Jacob Andreas, associate professor in EECS and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The research will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations.</p>
<p><strong>Modeling behavior</strong></p>
<p>Researchers have been building computational models of human behavior for decades. Many prior approaches try to account for suboptimal decision-making by adding noise to the model. Instead of the agent always choosing the correct option, the model might have that agent make the correct choice 95 percent of the time.</p>
<p>However, these methods can fail to capture the fact that humans do not always<em> </em>behave suboptimally in the same way.</p>
<p>Others at MIT have also <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/building-machines-better-understand-human-goals-1214" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studied more effective ways</a> to plan and infer goals in the face of suboptimal decision-making.</p>
<p>To build their model, Jacob and his collaborators drew inspiration from prior studies of chess players. They noticed that players took less time to think before acting when making simple moves and that stronger players tended to spend more time planning than weaker ones in challenging matches.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, we saw that the depth of the planning, or how long someone thinks about the problem, is a really good proxy of how humans behave,” Jacob says.</p>
<p>They built a framework that could infer an agent’s depth of planning from prior actions and use that information to model the agent’s decision-making process.</p>
<p>The first step in their method involves running an algorithm for a set amount of time to solve the problem being studied. For instance, if they are studying a chess match, they might let the chess-playing algorithm run for a certain number of steps. At the end, the researchers can see the decisions the algorithm made at each step.</p>
<p>Their model compares these decisions to the behaviors of an agent solving the same problem. It will align the agent’s decisions with the algorithm’s decisions and identify the step where the agent stopped planning.</p>
<p>From this, the model can determine the agent’s inference budget, or how long that agent will plan for this problem. It can use the inference budget to predict how that agent would react when solving a similar problem.</p>
<p><strong>An interpretable solution</strong></p>
<p>This method can be very efficient because the researchers can access the full set of decisions made by the problem-solving algorithm without doing any extra work. This framework could also be applied to any problem that can be solved with a particular class of algorithms.</p>
<p>“For me, the most striking thing was the fact that this inference budget is very interpretable. It is saying tougher problems require more planning or being a strong player means planning for longer. When we first set out to do this, we didn’t think that our algorithm would be able to pick up on those behaviors naturally,” Jacob says.</p>
<p>The researchers tested their approach in three different modeling tasks: inferring navigation goals from previous routes, guessing someone’s communicative intent from their verbal cues, and predicting subsequent moves in human-human chess matches.</p>
<p>Their method either matched or outperformed a popular alternative in each experiment. Moreover, the researchers saw that their model of human behavior matched up well with measures of player skill (in chess matches) and task difficulty.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the researchers want to use this approach to model the planning process in other domains, such as reinforcement learning (a trial-and-error method commonly used in robotics). In the long run, they intend to keep building on this work toward the larger goal of developing more effective AI collaborators.</p>
<p>This work was supported, in part, by the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing Artificial Intelligence for Augmentation and Productivity program and the National Science Foundation.</p>
